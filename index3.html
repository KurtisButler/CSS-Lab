            <h2>The Secret of Yamamba</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, a Buddhist priest was caught out in a storm but luckily passed by a lonely hut. A kind
                old woman invited him inside, welcoming him with food and a warm fire. As welcoming as she was, she gave
                the priest a strange warning: “No matter what, do not look in the back room.</p>

            <h2>The Legend of Jorogumo</h2>
            <p>A young samurai was accosted in the street by an alluringly gorgeous woman. Although she was beautiful,
                the samurai saw through her disguise, realizing she was not a human but some kind of yokai. He
                immediately drew his sword and plunged it towards her, but only injuring the strange woman before she
                quickly retreated. The samurai followed the scarlet trail of spotted blood, all the way to an old,
                abandoned house. Inside, he found dozens of bodies bound in spider silk, and a giant Joro spider, dead
                from the injuries it had received.

            <h2>The Tale of Oiwa</h2>
            <p>Oiwa was a stunningly beautiful young woman who was married to the samurai Iemon, a petty man who only
                loved her for her head-turning looks. Another woman, Oume, was madly in love with Iemon and out of
                jealous rage, she tricked Oiwa into using a cream that was laced with poison. It disfigured Oiwa’s face,
                causing one of her eyes to droop and her hair to fall out, without her even noticing.</p>

            <h2>The Woman of the Snow (Yuki-Onna)</h2>
            <p>A young man in search of his fortune was passing through the snow-covered mountains, when he’s caught in
                a sudden snowstorm and loses his way. Nearly frozen to death, he almost gives up hope when a strange
                woman, covered in frost and with a face as pale as snow, appeared before him—a Yuki-onna. Because he was
                still so young, the Yuki-onna took pity on him, and guided him to a warm cabin in the woods, saving his
                life. In exchange for his rescue, however, she made him promise never to tell anyone of their meeting.
